							<h1>Introducing Me</h1>
							<p class="major">Hello, friends! My name is Audrey.</p>
							<p class="major">A little about me. I'm a senior at Virginia Tech majoring in Political Science (ugh, politics), but my dream job is to run my own daycare which I didn't figure out until this year. I'm a big people person and I will talk your ear off if you give me the time of day... you have been warned. I love giving gifts, but I'm terrible at keeping them a secret. If you find me in front of the TV, I'm probably watching New Girl or as I like to call it "my comfort show." And while my stature may be small, I make up for it in my big personality.</p>
							<p class="major">Anyway, enough about me. On this wesbite you'll be able to find my hydroponics blog, a podcast I made with friends about streaming services, some helpful tips on how to stop yourself from binging all your favorite shows, and a YouTube video highlighting my favorite cruelty-free makeup products! Happy scrolling! <i class="far fa-smile"></i></a></p>

							<h2>No Soil? No Problem!</h2>
							<p>Hydroponics? I've heard of her! Check out my blog post where I touch on what hydropnic gardening is, the history of this method of growing, and the benefits of hydropnics compared to traditional methods of gardening. Plus, at the end of the blog you'll find information on how to start your own at home hydroponic system! Click on the link below to check it out!</p>

							<h2>Don't Get Stuck Binging</h2>
							<p>Now that you've listened to our podcast, you might be considering your own streaming habits. Don't worry, though.

						<h2>Caring Means Cruelty Free</h2>
						<p>I admit, I am a huge animal lover and I mean all animals. I often get teased by family and friends because I'll take the extra steps (and face the fear) to catch and release a spider that got inside before I ever consider squashing it. I just don't like harming other living creatures. So, it's probably no surprise that I choose cruelty-free makeup products. To all my makeup-wearing gals and guys out there - using quality cruelty-free products doesn't have to be hard or expensive. Check out my YouTube video where I talk about some of my favorite cruelty-free, drug-store products!</p>
